Sepsis is a life threating condition that may arise as a response to an
 infection.
 When occured, it often requires ICU admission.
 Hence, it accounts for 30% of ICU admissions
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ICU_SEPS_STATS"

\end_inset

.
 Sepsis will often be charactherized with a drop in blood pressure, which
 in turn will reduce the blood supplied to vital organs.
 It is a deadly condition, with an estimated mortality rate of 38%

 is a drug, based on a chemical substance with the same name.
 It constricts the blood vessels in the body, thus increasing the blood
 pressure (drugs with this property are known as Vasopressors).
 NE is considered to be the gold standard when treating Sepsis,

\begin_layout Standard
However, apart from this rule of thumb, there are no patient-level guidelines
 to instruct treatment for a specific patient.
 For example, even though there is an explicit target goal MAP

Mean Arterial Pressure is a measure of the average pressure in the arteries
 during one cardiac cycle.
 Calculated from the Systolic and Diastolic BP: MAP = 
\begin_inset Formula $\unitfrac{(2\cdot\ diastolic\ BP)+systolic\ BP]}{3}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

, there is no regards for the specific patient's MAP trajectory.
 Thus, it shoud come as no surprise that there is a high variablity in Sepsis
 treatment patterns

\begin_layout Standard
It is only natural that attempts at harnessing Artifcial Intelligence for
 this task will come about.
 Such was the vast work published in 2018 Nature Medicine (

 In this work, a Reinforcment Learning

 based model was developed to suggest optimal treatment patterns: mainly
 doses of Vasopressors and IV fluids.
 The target of the model was to reduce the patients' mortality as much as
 possible, be it in the ICU or 90-day mortatlity.
 The model included a set of 48 patient variables: from demographics, to
 vitals signs and labratory results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although promisingly claiming:

 the AI decisions
\begin_inset Quotes erd

,

the work raised substantial criticism and concern regarding applying the
 model in actual clincal use.

 it is apparent that the AI preformed better than human clinicians.
 However, it is alarming to see that on average, 
\series bold
no interference policy was actually better, 
\series default
in terms of estimated policy value,
\series bold

than both the AI and the human clincian's policy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This issue, as well as a recreation of the results and comparing the AI's
 suggestions to clincian's descisions for indvidual patient's trajectories
 are discussed in great lengths in the 2019 review by Jeter, Josef, Shashikumar,
 & Nemati 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "clinician_review"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 .
 One crucial keypoint of criticism discussed by Jeter et al is the sole
 focus of the 2018 work on long term rewards: hospital and 90-days morbidity.
 It disregarded the importance of intermediate short term rewards, in particular
 stablizing a patient's vitals and mainting their MAP in the recommended
 values, which bares more resemblance to a clinican's methodology in decsion
 making.

The abovementioned works were trained on MIMIC-III (Medical Information
 Mart for Intensive Care) - a publicly available database of patients admitted

 in 2016

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, we used the eICU Collaborative Research Database.
 It is a large, comprehensive dataset of critical care data collected from
 over 200 ICUs at multiple hospitals across the United States.
 The database covers patients who were admitted to critical care units in
 2014 and 2015, and was made publicly available at 2018

Areas of focus in our work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our overall goal in this work was to understand desicion making in the ICU.
 As a first step, we wanted to give additional evidence for the lack of
 uniform Sepsis treatment patterns in the ICU.
 Secondly we seeked to create a simple, interpetive baseline model for decision
 making in the task of stabilizing a Sepsis patient to a given Mean Arterial
 Blood Pressure (MAP) value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Treatmeant Variability Assessment between ICU units
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned, evidence regarding the variability in treatment patterns has
 been published, like the work preformed by Bray et al (2020)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sepsis_Treatment_Variability"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This work analyzed the variability by comparing Sepsis treatment protocols
 in different medical units in the UK's healthcare system (NHS Trusts).
 Considerable variation was found: from which factors define a patient as
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high risk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to treatment steps recommended in a patient's pathway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though MIMIC does not contain any identifying data on which clinician
 gave a specific treatment, we seeked to assess the Sepsis treatment variablity
 evident in the data.
 A possible mediator was to look at the treatment variability across between
 different ICU units.
 Two particular units interesed proposed by our project leaders were the
 Medical ICU (MICU) and the Surgical ICU (SICU).
 Those two units differ in both their patient populations (SICU hosts patients
 before / after surgeries) and their care-taker population.
 Previous research
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MICU_VS_SICU_SEP"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 found that Sepsis has more impact on SICU patients, and thus mesaures of
 preventing Sepsis in the SICU patients should be most effective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We seeked to find evidence for differences in treatment - which we limited
 to the NOR dosage that patients with similar MAP recieved in the different
 units.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Basic MAP Stabilization Recommendation Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We seeked to create a simple interpeteble Reinforcement Learning model to
 recommend short term MAP stabilization of Sepsis patients.
 Unlike the 2018 Nature's Clinician, this model will not seek to minimize
 long-term hindsight morbidity, but will look to keep a Sepsis patient's
 MAP value at a stable range.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For simplicity, our model used only single most important feature for MAP
 stabilization which is the MAP value itself.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Permutations Test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Statistical test useds to determine whether two observations were drawn
 from the same distribution.
 It is a non-parametric approach - does not require knowing the distribution
 of the data.
 The test is preformed by randomly taking two groups of the distribution
 and computing the test statistic (e.g difference of means) with shuffeled
 labels.
 The p-value is calculated as the fraction of randomly labeled iterations
 that had a more extreme test statistic value than that of the original
 dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Kolmogorov Smoirnov Test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional Non-parametric test to determine whether two samples come from
 the same underlying distribution.
 the KST works by calculating CDFs for the two samples and comparing the
 maximal difference between them.
 The maximal difference is known as the KS statistic:
\begin_inset Formula $D_{KS}=\sup_{x}\left|F\left(x\right)-G\left(x\right)\right|$
\end_inset

, which can be used to generate p-values for the hypothesis 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}:F=G$

Reinforcement Learning (RNL) is a class of Machine Learning, which corresponds
 to a set of problems and solutions.
 The key factors which differs it from Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
 is that in RNL the solver (Agent) interacts with the enviroment in a dynamic
 way, looking to optimzie a certain reward function.
 A usual RNL process follows the procedure:

\end_layout

Additional resolution achieved in this method is the shape of the distributions
 we see that the peak of the distribution of MICU tends to be lower than
 SICU, which indicates a higher range of dose values given by the doctors
 in MICU (In SICU doctors tend to give dosage which is close to 0.05 across
 all groups).

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Setting and Terminology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We've implemented the RNL framework for our task at hand: keeping the patient's
 MAP value at a prespecified target MAP.
 The formulation is natural for this problem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Agent - the caretaker, which decides which action to take.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
States - represented as the MAP bin of the patient.
 We defined the bins in 5 MAP values intervals:
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}=\left[\left(0,5\right),\left(5,10\right),\ldots,\left(195,200\right)\right].$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Actions - NOR dosage.
 In order to define a finite set of possible doses, we decided to limit
 the set of possible actions to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}=\left\{ 0,0.01,\ldots0.4\right\} $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reward function - we decided to define ahead of training the goal of maximizing
 the amount of time a patient spents in the recommended area of 65 MAP.
 Therfore the reward function was defined to be the negative square distance
 from 65 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{t}=-\left\Vert s_{t}-65\right\Vert ^{2}$
\end_inset

 (negative since we are looking to maximze the reward function in RNL algorithms
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Policy - determines which NOR dosage to give to a patient at a given state.
 The agent's goal is to learn the optimal policy in terms of the cumlative
 reward generated from the reward function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Episode - The trajectory of states, actions and rewards for a single patient.
 Starting from his arrival to the ICU (or the initial data point available)
 to the last.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Offline RNL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In classic RNL setting, the agent has the freedom to knowingly make explorative
 non-optimal desicions with the goal of widening its knowledge on the enviroment.
 For our task and data this is neither possible (since we have a static
 dataset) nor ethical (doing so would mean taking knowingly wrong choices
 in patient treatment).
 The solution is Offline RNL - the agent learns

 from dataset

 that was collected prior training according to

 any

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Markov Property and Modeling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As is the case in many RNL based models, our model assumes the decision
 process represented in the data adheres to the Markov property.
 Formally, given a trajectory of states (i.e MAP values) 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1},\ldots,s_{t},$
\end_inset

and an action (NOR doseage) 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{t}\in\left\{ 0,0.01,\ldots,0.4\right\} ,$
\end_inset

the next state 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 will depend solely on the action and the previous state.
 That is, the transition function 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau:\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 satifies:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau\left(s_{t+1},a_{t}\mid s_{0},\ldots,s_{t}\right)=\tau\left(s_{t+1},a_{t}\mid s_{t}\right)
\]

 Each instance of this class has a MAP state, and can be interacted with

 will change the patient's MAP according to an estimation of the transition
 probabilities - 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tau}.$
\end_inset

 A natural way to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is by sampling the training data after conditioning.
 We'll define 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tau}$
\end_inset

 as the marginal probability of a state 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 given the previous 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}$
\end_inset

 and action 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Formally, given dataset 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D},$
\end_inset

 define the subsets: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}_{\ast\mid s_{t},a_{t}}$
\end_inset

- All entries in the dataset where action 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{t}$
\end_inset

 was taken following the state 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Separator plain
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}_{s_{t+1}\mid s_{t},a_{t}}$
\end_inset

- Entries in the dataset that are equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t+1}$
\end_inset

, and followed the tuple 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(s_{t},a_{t}\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The natural estimator for the transition probability will be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\tau}=\left(s_{t+1},a_{t}\mid s_{t}\right)=\frac{\left|\mathcal{D}_{s_{t+1}\mid s_{t},a_{t}}\right|}{\left|\mathcal{D}_{\ast\mid s_{t},a_{t}}\right|}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
This estimator is a generalization of the MLE for transition matrix in a
 classic Markov Chain (without actions).
 It can be proven that in a Markov Chain model 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}$
\end_inset

 where one looks to find the transition probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}=P\left(X_{t+1}=j\mid X_{t}=i\right),$
\end_inset

the MLE estimator is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}_{ij}=\frac{n_{ij}}{\sum_{j}n_{ij}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the number of instances of the tuple of states 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(X_{i},X_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 across trajectories, and the summation in the denominator is across all
 possible states 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "markov_lme"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 If we were to define a new state set from the cartesian product of the
 states and actions sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}^{\prime}:=\left\{ \left(s,a\right)\in\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\right\} ,$
\end_inset

 our 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tau}$
\end_inset

 will converge with the MLE estimator for the transition probability in
 that model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, 
\series bold
\shape italic
Patient Simulator

does not calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tau}$
\end_inset

 explicitly.
 It samples the next state from the group 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}_{\ast\mid s_{t},a_{t}}$
\end_inset

, which implies the transition probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tau}$
\end_inset

 over the states.
 Therefore, states for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}_{s_{t+1}\mid s_{t},a_{t}}=\emptyset$
\end_inset

 will have zero probability.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Initialization and Termination of Epsiodes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two important edge cases left to be considered were how to start and end
 an episode in the patient simulator.
 In order to be as close to the data as possible, we decided to sample the
 starting point randomly from all states which appear as the starting point
 for a patient in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, when we happen to sample using the transition function 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tau}$
\end_inset

 a state 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 which happens to be a terminal state for a particular patient, we will
 terminate the episode.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Model Training Algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We choose to train our RNL model using Q-Learning Monte Carlo algorithm.
 The main idea of the algorithm is to iterativly estimate the state-action
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\pi}\left(s,a\right)$
\end_inset

, calculate the optimal policy 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 using it, play an episode using the policy 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi,$
\end_inset

and update the 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 function using the newly aquired data from the episode.
 We also used the 
\shape italic
first-visit variation 
\shape default
of the algorithm, which is an optimization variant that skips re-evaluating
 the same state-action pairs in the same episode (for effiency).
 This variation is widely studied, and is referenced in page 128 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The algorithm assumes (and takes as an input) an episode simulator which
 is able to generate a series of states, action and following rewards :
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \left(s_{t},a_{t},r_{t}\right)\right\} _{t=0}^{k}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $s_{k}$
\end_inset

 being the terminal state).
 In our setting, the Episode simulator is implemented via the class

The policy appears to be in complete disorder, similar to Gaussian noise.
 The Estimated category value has more order to it, reflecting the reward
 function: in the higher bins the estimated value is 0, since no entries

The eICU offers a higher time resolution of BP measurements.
 While patients in MIMIC have an average of one measurement per hour, in
 the eICU time resolution is every five minutes.
 This encouraged us to process the eICU data to fit our RNL framework as
 well, and train our model using this data.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
MICU - SICU Comparision
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As expected, we witnessed major differences between the doses given to patients
 with similar BP.
 In both the KST and Permutations test, most groups had significant differences,
 apart from the bin which didn't have enough samples - 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,49\right)$
\end_inset

, and bins near the target value.
 This finding supporting previous research on Sepsis treatment variability,
 showing that there is no uniform policy for treatment, even within the
 same hospital.
 Examing the CDF of NOR doses for each BP group provided additional insights
 to the differences between SICU and MICU, and showed that there is higher
 treatment variability in the MICU on patients with the similar MAP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that the tests split the patients solely on their
 MAP values, and did not split to internal cohorts within each bin.
 It is only natural that patients in SICU and MICU will have different symptoms
 and Physiology, and therfore may require different treatment.
 A finer test of treatment variability could have been comparing the decisions
 different doctors made within the same unit, and perfably in treating the
 same patient.
 This could not have been done using MIMIC, as it doesn't hold any data
 on the doctor who made the desicion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The high variability in Sepsis treatment, even within the same hospital,
 indicates potential for the effectiveness of an AI-based model.
 Such model will not be limited to the treating expirence a single human
 clinican can obtain in a lifetime, and could make desicion based on huge
 train datasets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
RNL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We've estabilshed a simple, short-term RNL model, looking to stabilize a
 patient near the target MAP value of 65.
 Training the model on MIMIC data provided poor results, which were highly
 entropied and did not pass the reasonability test.
 The model makes the Markovian assumption, which likely does not hold in
 low time resolution data like MIMIC (BP mesaurement every hour).
 However, training the model on the eICU data, which had a higher time resolutio
n (~mesaurement every 5 min on average) showed much more plausible and less
 entropied results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The initial target of our study was to preform behaivoral analysis - check
 what is the target MAP that doctors in different units aim to.
 In this study we found that 
\series bold
in order to learn
\series default
 
\series bold
behaviors, we need a close temporal resolution 
\series default
- between the MAP value observed and the desicion (NOR dose) that followed.
 As proof of this, we showed that learning from a higher resolution data
 gives more plausible policies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Focusing on a short term model holds potential for clincal applications.
 It uses the key factor crucial for maintaining the patient alive in the
 state of Septic shock - the MAP, and could be relevant to situations where
 only the short goal of stabilizing the patient is important.
 Simple models are also easier to train, as the state space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 is smaller (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 grows exponentially with each variable added).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulted model are far from being clinicaly relevant and applicable.
 A crucial first step will be to compare the model's suggestions on actual
 patients to the decisions made by the doctor, and check if they are within
 a reasonable range.
 Look into the areas of disagreement between the clinician and the AI, and
 use the hindsight test to verify who was right (e.g - AI suggested higher
 dose, the patient's BP did not rise, doctor had to adjust and vice-versa).

The main part of the project is analyzing the decision making of the medical
 teams.
 Since the most important part if thehuman decision, The idea of decision
 filter is to keep only events of doses that were taken by a medical authority,
 and were not recorded automatically.
 In contrast to the previous filters, in which data was kept because of
 accurate condition that was fulfilled, the case of decisions filter is
 different.
 There is no field in the data that indicates if the dose recorded due to
 a decision of a human or not.
\begin_inset Newline linebreak

Since there is no such field, we need to define what decision is by other
 propereties we do have:
