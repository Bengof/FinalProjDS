Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Sepsis is a life threating condition that may arise as a response to an
 infection.
 When occured, it often requires ICU admission.
 Hence, it accounts for 30% of ICU admissions

.
 Sepsis will often be charactherized with a drop in blood pressure, which
 in turn will reduce the blood supplied to vital organs.
 It is a deadly condition, with an estimated mortality rate of 38%

 is a drug, based on a chemical substance with the same name.
 It constricts the blood vessels in the body, thus increasing the blood
 pressure (drugs with this property are known as Vasopressors).
 NE is considered to be the gold standard when treating Sepsis,

However, apart from this rule of thumb, there are no patient-level guidelines
 to instruct treatment for a specific patient.
 For example, even though there is an explicit target goal MAP, there is
 no regards for the specific patient's MAP trajectory.
 Thus, it shoud come as no surprise that there is a high variablity in Sepsis
 treatment patterns

It is only natural that attempts at harnessing Artifcial Intelligence for
 this task will come about.
 Such was the vast work published 2018 Nature Medicine (

\shape default
 
\series bold
Komorowski et al

).
 In this work, a Reinforcment Learning

 based model was developed to suggest optimal treatment patterns: mainly
 doses of Vasopressors and IV fluids.
 The target of the model was to limit the patients' mortality, be it in
 the ICU or 90-day mortatlity.
 The model included a set of 48 patient variables: from demographics, to
 vitals signs and labratory results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although promisingly claiming:

mortality was lowest in patients for whom cliniciansâ€™ actual doses matched
 the AI decisions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\shape default
the work raised substantial criticism and concern regarding applying the
 model in actual clincal use.
 For example in the following figure taken from the manuscript :

 it is apparent that the AI preformed better than human clinicians However,
 it is alarming to see that on average, 
\series bold
no interference policy was actually better 
\series default
than both the AI and the human clincian's policy, in terms of estimated
 value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This issue, as well as a recreation of the results and comparing the AI's
 suggestions to clincian's descisions for indvidual patient's trajectories
 are discussed in great lengths in the 2019 review by Jeter, R., Josef, C.,
 Shashikumar, S., & Nemati, S.
 (2019)

\end_inset

 .
 One crucial keypoint of criticism discussed by Jeter et al is the sole
 focus of the 2018 work on long term rewards: hospital and 90-days morbidity.
 It disregarded the importance of intermediate short term rewards, in particular
 stablizing a patient's vitals and mainting their MAP in the recommended
 values, which is more similar to the clinican's methodology in decsion
 making.

We divided the inputs data to groups according to their last blood pressure
 measurement before receiving the Norepinephrine:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
BP\ RANGES=\left[\underset{b_{0}}{\underbrace{(0,44)}},\underset{b_{1}}{\underbrace{(45,49)}},\underset{b_{2}}{\underbrace{(50,54)}},\ldots,\underset{b_{13}}{\underbrace{(105,109)}},\underset{b_{14}}{\underbrace{(110,114)}},\underset{b_{15}}{\underbrace{(115,200)}}\right]
\]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After doing so, we want to check for each group the hypothesis that the
 treatment will be the same across different units, against the conjecture
 that treatment varies.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{M,b_{j}}$
\end_inset

 denote the expected value of the Medical ICU unit for the group with bp
 in the range denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}$
\end_inset

, and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{S,b_{j}}$
\end_inset

(for Surgical ICU).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by checking each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $16$

Interim summary of data filters

By applying all the filters we got 754 MB that we could load into the memory

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Decisions Filter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main part of the project is analyzing the decision making of the medical
 teams.
 Since the most important part if thehuman decision, The idea of decision
 filter is to keep only events of doses that were taken by a medical authority,
 and were not recorded automatically.
 In contrast to the previous filters, in which data was kept because of
 accurate condition that was fulfilled, the case of decisions filter is
 different.
 There is no field in the data that indicates if the dose recorded due to
 a decision of a human or not.
\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset

Since there is no such field, we need to define what decision is by other
 propereties we do have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold

\series default
 - there are 5 status descriptions in the input event files, and one of
 them is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 by the documentation of MIMIC-IV that status means:

.
 It infers that those records are not an active decision of a human.
 Deeper investigation of those records shows that indeed the rate of those
 records is not one that human will decide to type manually (like 0.080032155,
 0.10005264, 0.3417207 )
